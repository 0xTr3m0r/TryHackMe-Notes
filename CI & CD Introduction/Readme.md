# CI/CD Pipelines – Introduction & Utility

## **What Are CI/CD Pipelines?**

CI/CD pipelines are a set of practices and tools that **automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software**. They ensure that software can be delivered to users **quickly, reliably, and with fewer errors**.

## **1. What is CI (Continuous Integration)?**

- **Definition:**  
  Continuous Integration is the practice of automatically **building and testing code whenever developers commit changes** to a shared repository.

- **Goal:**  
  To detect bugs early by integrating code frequently.

- **Example Process:**
  1. A developer pushes new code to GitHub.
  2. The CI pipeline triggers automatically.
  3. The pipeline builds the application and runs unit tests.
  4. If tests pass, the code is merged safely; if not, the developer is notified.

- **Example Tools:**  
  - Jenkins  
  - GitHub Actions  
  - GitLab CI  
  - CircleCI  
  - Travis CI

## **2. What is CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)?**

- **Continuous Delivery:**  
  Extends CI by automatically preparing code for **release to production**, but a **manual approval step** may be required.

- **Continuous Deployment:**  
  Goes one step further by **automatically deploying every successful build** to production without manual intervention.

- **Goal:**  
  To ensure new features, bug fixes, or updates can be released **quickly and frequently**.

- **Example Process:**
  1. After CI tests pass, the code is packaged (e.g., Docker image).
  2. The pipeline deploys it to a **staging environment** for further testing.
  3. (For Continuous Deployment) The code is automatically deployed to **production** if no issues are found.

- **Example Tools:**  
  - ArgoCD  
  - Spinnaker  
  - AWS CodePipeline  
  - Azure DevOps

## **3. Why Use CI/CD Pipelines?**

- **Faster development:** Automated builds and deployments save time.  
- **Reduced bugs:** Tests catch issues early.  
- **Consistent releases:** Eliminates manual deployment errors.  
- **Collaboration-friendly:** Works well with teams using Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

## **4. Real-World Example**

Imagine a web app hosted on AWS:

1. **CI Phase:**  
   - GitHub Actions builds the app and runs tests whenever a developer pushes code.  
   - If tests fail, developers are alerted.  

2. **CD Phase:**  
   - A Docker image of the app is built and pushed to AWS ECR.  
   - AWS CodePipeline automatically deploys the new version to an ECS cluster (production).

## **5. Quick Example of a CI/CD Pipeline (YAML)**

Here’s a simple **GitHub Actions** pipeline for a Node.js app:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t my-app .
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: ./deploy.sh
